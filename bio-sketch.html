<p><span class="paragraph_text">Ezra </span>&quot;Eazy&quot; Hazell was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, where he found the talent of learning about computers. Ezra from the little age of 3 was fascinated with technology that he planned on growing up to become a Robotics Engineer. With such an interest in computer technology Ezra has found himself learning how to build, program, and troubleshoot computers. Ezra then became to develop his skills in troubleshooting computer networks and desktop support. </p>
<p>It wasn't until Ezra enrolled himself to George Mason University, as a Computer Engineer where Ezra has learned about other growing technologies. While in college Ezra started learning about the Internet and the World Wide Web and how to build and design web pages. As Ezra began to learn more about designing web pages he later sought out to learn
how to increase his skills as a web designer. It wasn't until then when Ezra found a job on the campus of George Mason University at the university's multimedia lab where Ezra started to work. Ezra started out as a front desk/customer service clerk but began learning the different web and graphic tools and applications that his workplace provided for students and faculty. While working there Ezra began to teach himself on how to use various software programs like, Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, PageMaker, Dreamweaver, Adobe Premiere, and Fireworks. Ezra knew that these programs would help him to become a well-advanced Web and Graphics designer. Ezra also knew that with his knowledge in HTML programming in conjunction with the various web and graphics applications, he can develop and design web pages never seen before by his peers.</p>
<p>As a student and employee Ezra has began to create a reputation and name for himself designing flyers and other publications for local and on-campus organizations. That was when Ezra knew that this was the start of a new beginning. Ezra fell in love with his new found talent in web and graphics design that he decided to turn this passion of a hobby into a business for himself. Then Ezra created, Eazy Dezigns, a web and graphics company which he named after his childhood nickname Eazy. Eazy Dezigns began to make a name for itself and Ezra continued to create and design artwork and web pages for those who requested. Ezra believes that God has blessed him with a talent for designing and knew the only way to show forth what Ezra can do is to put it on display for all to see. Ezra did not want to hide the talent that he was blessed with and decided to share it for the sake of helping others.
