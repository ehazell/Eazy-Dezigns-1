        1993, these seven young men have been singing the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
        breaking down racial, denominational, and gender barriers in the process. 
        Based out of Manassas, Virginia, the Youthful Spirits have made their 
        mark in the area, and are continuing to expand their ministry as the Lord 
        sees fit.</b></font></font><font size="3"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">

        It is popular today to categorizegospel artists today according to style 
        and the "target audience" of a group. However, the Youthful Spirits have 
        been compared to various artists like Commissioned of the late 80's, the 
        Canton Spirituals, Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers, and even the Winans 
        of the mid 80's. The Youthful Spirits are as comfortable singinga traditional 
        hymn such as "Father Along" at a nursing home as they are singing a hip-hop/Go-Go 
        styled version of "WeCome To Praise Him" at an inner city youth lock-in 
        at a school gymnasium. Whether they are singing their unique rendition 
        of the National Anthem at the 22,000 seat MCI Center, or writing and acting 
        in a gospel play in front of a handful of young people on Halloween night, 
        the Youthful Spirits are always ready to proclaim the name of the Lord 
        in a song. <br>
        <br>
        Ranging in ages from 18-24, the Youthful Spirits are moving forward in 
        the work force, college, and even the armed forces. Keyboardist James 
        Wigington Jr., vocalist Roderick Jeter Jr., saxophonist Robert Maletick, 
        and drummer Mike Fields are all nearing graduation from George Mason, 
        Shenandoah Universities, and the University of Virginia respectively. 
        Vocalist Mike Coleman, Marc Fields Jr., and Stevie Tibbs Jr., have already 
        ventured into the workforce, while auxiliary percussionist Mike Mitchell 
        and Kenny Harris are in the midst of service for the U.S. Army. <br>
        <br>
        The Youthful Spirits have been blessed to minister with many of the gospel 
        music industries finest, including minister John P. Kee and New Life, 
        the Georgia Mass Choir, Walt Whitman and the Soul Children of Chicago, 
        the Christianaires, the Gospel Keynotes, Rev. Timothy Wright, Kirk Whalum, 
        the Williams Brothers, and many others. They regularly minister in concerts 
        in Virginia, Washington D.C., Maryland, and Pennsylvania. The Youthful 
        Spirits rendition of the national anthem has been heard at high schools, 
        colleges, and pro basketball games across Virginia and Washington D.C. 
        they have also participated in free concerts at military prisons, nursing 
        homes, and charitable foundations. The Darrell Green Foundation, Vibe 
        Magazine, BET SoundStage, Gospel Music Workshop of America(GMWA), Up Where 
        We Belong television and radio ministry, and the C.I.T.Y.(Christians Involved 
        Together with Youth) youth outreach are just some the local, regional, 
        and national organizations that YS has worked with. <br>
        <br>
        The Youthful Spirits have released two successful independent projects 
        entitled "Look Within Your Heart"(1996) and "YS 4 Life"(1998). Also during 
        that time, keyboardist James Wigington released an independent project 
        "Boys to Men, Blessed by Mercy"(1997) and saxophonist Robert Maliteck 
        released a solo project entitled "Walking the Path." All four projects 
        received substantial airplay, with the "YS 4 Life" album currently a fixture 
        on the Washington area gospel stations. At the moment, the Youthful Spirits 
        are a self contained unit, with assistance from managers Terry Orr and 
        Ruben Cuffee. <br>
        <br>
        The Youthful Spirits would like to one day expand their ministry to a 
        national and fulltime basis. They are ready and willing to promote, travel, 
        learn, and do whatever is spiritually and musically necessary to take 
        them to the next level. But even if the Youthful Spirits never reach the 
        point that they are singing for a career, they know without a shadow of 
        a doubt that they will always sing for the true and living God, and that's 
        the ONE and ONLY Jesus Christ the King. May God bless you.</font></b></font></div>
