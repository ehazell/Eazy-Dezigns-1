            Marshall Jeter Jr., also known as &quot;Tiki&quot;, was born on Clarke 
            Air-Force Base Oct. 12, 1977. Arriving back to the United States in 
            1990, it was then the family decided that it would be in the city 
            of Manassas, VA where they would reside until both children completed 
            their education. Upon completing his sophomore year at U of R, Rod 
            transferred to GMU majoring in International Business. Some of the 
            organizations he has been a part of since he has been at GMU: Alpha 
            Chi, Honor Society, Black Student Alliance, Shabach for Christ Ministry, 
            Youthful Spirits, GMU NAACP and GMU Gospel Choir, Anointed Voices 
            of Unity. Rod is working towards establishing his own international 
            organization; one which is rooted in Christian principles, and who's 
            mission is to advance the ever-saving power of Jesus Christ through 
            outreach, service, promotion and empowerment. It is at First New Birth 
            Baptist Church where he has been a member for 8 years, and where the 
            Rev. John E. Blackmon Sr. is the residing pastor and founder.</font></p>

          the racial boundaries still evident in today's music Rob Maletick has 
          challenged himself to make a difference with the gifts that God has 
          given him Christian music is still separated by skin color, and by combining 
          Gospel and Jazz music Rob wishes to communicate the idea that color 
          makes no difference. As a young saxophonist, age 23, Rob brings a youthful 
          approach to a genre dominated by older musicians. Starting a record 
          label with his brother, Chris releasing a debut album entitled <cite><i>Walking 
          The Path,</i></cite> and performing with world-renowned artists has 
          started a career for Rob that has already drawn international attention. 
          While studying Jazz performance and Music Business at Shenandoah University 
          Rob performed with many notable Jazz artists such as Randy Brecker, 
          Dr. Billy Taylor, Bob Berg, Chris Vadala, and Saul Miller to name a 
          few. As a member of the Shenandoah Jazz Ensemble, Rob toured Europe 
          in the summer of 1995 and Asia in the summer of 1996. These experiences 
          laid the ground work and technical training needed for a future in the 
          recording industry. The Gospel-Jazz Saxophonist is a title Rob takes 
          quite seriously. &quot;I believe instrumental Gospel music allows God 
          to talk to an individual level, with no words or preconceived ideas 
          to get in the way.&quot; Using his deep jazz background and roots in 
          the Church, Rob has created a unique musical style that has a Biblical 
          value, yet is easily heard on smooth jazz radio. </font></p>
