  is a Christian design company<br>
  specializing in web and graphics design. We<br>
  are fulfilling the need of graphics and designs<br>
  to Christian ministries all across the nation. There<br>
  has been a need for an alternative to the secular<br>
  world. Eazy Dezigns has answered that call to make<br>
  sure that ministries spread the gospel across the<br>
  world. In many ways, Eazy Dezigns has created<br>
  designs and artwork that has brought non-believers<br>
  close to God and has helped ministries reach young<br>
  people all over. From the suburbs to the urban inner<br>
  city youth, Eazy Dezigns has touched their hearts and<br>
  help them to build a closer relationship with God.<br>
  For it is not only our mission but our motto to make<br>
  sure that every person, young or old heart will be<br>
  touched by the creative artwork inspired by God and<br>
  will find not only truth but also God's love and will<br>
  want to build a closer relationship with Him.<br>
